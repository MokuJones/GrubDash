# Project: GrubDash

You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash!
As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that
the frontend developers can demo out some initial design ideas to the big bosses.

## Learning Objectives
- Run tests from the command line.
- Use common middleware packages.
- Receive requests through routes.
- Access relevant information through route parameters.
- Build an API following RESTful design principles.
- Write custom middleware functions.
